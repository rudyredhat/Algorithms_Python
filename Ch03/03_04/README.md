# Rate Of Growth Of Functions  

- Like if our problem takes so many diff functions like,
```
1000
log n
log^2 n / log^3 n
n
n^2
n^2 logn
n^3
2^n
n^n
.... so on
```
- But how to check which function is performing what way ?
- So to visualize there are diff sets below for n=100, graph between x-->n & y-->operations
1) logn < (logn)^2 < (logn)^3
2) n < n logn
3) n^2 < n^2 logn
4) n^3 (too much time consuming) 
5) 2^n (1e30 = 10^30, so like 100 input its taking this much of operations)
6) n^n (1e200 = 10^200 operations for 100 input
