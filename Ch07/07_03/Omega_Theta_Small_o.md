- For the function that is being written up we have used , Big Oh (O) for the upper bound.
- Now for the lower bond we are using Meu (μ) .
- So for the function = `2n2+50n+100 >= c.n2` so there exists some `∃no, ∃c`, but the function is not greater than for every n.
- For some point of n only the above function is satisfied, i.e `n >= no`
```           
    ∃no, ∃c
2n2+50n+100 >= c.n2
               n >= no
```
