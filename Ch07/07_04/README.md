# Rate Of Growth Of Functions  

- Like if our problem takes so many diff functions like,
```
1000
log n
log^2 n / log^3 n
n
n^2
n^2 logn
n^3
2^n
n^n
.... so on
```
- But how to check which function is performing what way ?
- So to visualize the above set of fuction we have the program above.
