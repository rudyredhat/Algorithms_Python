# Discussion of Storage Mappings for Array  
- `Operations` that are performed on `1-d array`.
  - Access / [ ]       - So it takes O(1) `T.C`
  - Size or Length     - So for size and length , O(1)
- [Storage Mapping division](https://github.com/rudyredhat/Algorithms_Python/tree/master/Ch01/01_03):
```
  STORAGE MAPPINGS   
      |              |---- Sequnetial
      |__LINEAR------|
      |              |---- Linked
      |                 |--- Tree
      |__NON-LINEAR-----|
                        |--- Hash
```                 
- For most of the lang, 1-d prefer `Sequential`.
