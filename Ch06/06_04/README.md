# Applying Metrics || Sorted Array Search
- comparison to problem in the `previous topic` , where T.C = Time complexity & S.C = Space Complexity
- `Naive/Brute Force `
  - T.C =  n comparison
  - S.C = c units/words
- `Divide & Prune Strategy`
	- T.C =  n comparison
  - S.C = c units/words (to manage and compare the random index, few words are more than enough, so we are taking c units/words)
- `Divide & Prune Strategy`
	- T.C = log n (base 2)
	- S.C = c units/words
- so from above we can select the `log n base 2 algorithm` taking less T.C
