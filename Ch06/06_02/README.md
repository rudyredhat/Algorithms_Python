# Metrics for Algorithm Analysis
- **2 metrics** = Time & Space
- In computer we have `Main memory, Processor/CPU, Disk`
- **Time Complexity**
	- Aspects
	- Independent of processor
	- Independent of programming lang
	- Independent of OS
- The `low level operation` req for the operation
- **Space Complexity**
	- Initial we will talk about the main memory
	- so word by word we access the ram 
	- Aspects
		- Independent of the hardware
	- The `number of words` taken by the algorithm
